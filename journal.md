"The digital environment allows for far more complex forms of data to be collected and processed." (Richardson, L.-J., 2019. Using Social Media as a Source for Understanding Public Perceptions of Archaeology: Research Challenges and Methodological Pitfalls. Journal of Computer Applications in Archaeology, 2.1, 151â€“162.)

Relatively simple and straight-forward quote today, that is not to say it does not hold value for this week's context and journal prompt. 
As far as the graveyard project goes, we have the ability to collect and manipulate a large pool of data concerning the respective graveyard. As the quote says, it can be quite complex. 
The main takeaway from many of the exercises that I have done this semester is not that you can get all sorts of data, but that you need to be careful with that data. 
This is what is creating the consequences for the communities that the graveyards serve. 
Not being wary of ethics surrounding many of the projects (i.e. 3d model, replicating data, raising the dead) may led to mis-representation.
As a graveyard may reflect a community and their respective family members, consequences for these communities representation is held by the archaeologist when creating conclusions, charts, models, whatever your research arrives at. 
Through the readings, replicating research, raising the dead, 3d modelling, databases, topic models, and more, I have come to learn this. 
I have also come to realize that you cannot let such a thing hinder you, but use it to become more versed in how to consider data, and how to better show it. 

Reflecting on this week, there was more fails than wins I would say. No issues annotating and reading, perhaps a win comes from learning from that. 
Otherwise, I had failed to create a hieroglyphic translation, and the second exercise did not work to begin with, or after multiple attempts based on Discord's solutions. 
I did come across some connections between the hieroglyphic translating and graveyard project however. 
Since I had failed to translate, but came across some words, I began wondering the dangers of trying to fill in the gaps myself. A story is trying to be told, important to culture, and if I were to incorrectly intervene it would hold consequence for anyone listening to me. 
Similarily, someone's grave tells a story of them, albeit briefly. Motifs, materials, fonts, engraving, it is all chosen for a reason by family members. I had better not misrepresent that either.
