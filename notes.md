All is well so far just reading and annotating.

Was able to annotate some things of Marwick's dayforarchaeology analysis. 

Attempted the hieroglyphics translation activity, went quite well but I did not end up with a complete sentence, only snippets like 'she' or 'him' or 'concerning'. 

Got an error saying "Error in library(rrtools) : there is no package called ‘rrtools’" 

Same error after re-running as Discord suggested, going to send a message and wait to attempt again tomorrow perhaps. 

Thursday evening, same issue... May have to call it a wrap for this week and write my journal.
